# admin-dashboard

This project mimics the general display of an admin dashboard page. The user can not interact with the page as much as it appears, as the page is only for practice, and not an actual dashboard. The project is somewhat dynamic, but may start to malfunction on certain screen resolutions. Throughout the whole project, flex-box was not used once, and grid took its place instead. This project displays an extensive use of CSS, HTML, and Grid.
